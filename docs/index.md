# Ontology Design Patterns for Representing Context

This website is about a collection of [ontology design patterns (ODPs)](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/) for representing context using the [W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) and a novel extension called [Aspect-Oriented Ontology Development](https://aspectowl.xyz).

These pages accommodate supplementary resources accompanying two peer-reviewed publications on the topic, the workshop paper *"Ontology Design Patterns for Representing Context in Ontologies Using Aspect Orientation"*[^1] and the equally-titled book chapter[^2], which is an extended version of the workshop paper.
